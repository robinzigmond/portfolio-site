# Portfolio site

A relatively simple website - the first I made using Django. Its purpose is to provide a kind of personal home page to show off my skills to potential employers - both by listing all my projects completed so far, as well as the techs I have used for them, and also by itself being one of those projects, showcasing things that I have not yet done in others.

The site is deployed at <http://robin.zigmond.uk>

Note that I have added settings.py to the .gitignore, mainly to hide the "secret key". [Actually, for some reasons I couldn't get the .gitignore to work - but I have altered the value used in production so there is now no harm in it being here.] There are in any case some differences in settings between the version I have been using locally and the one deployed on the server.
