            <h3><strong>My story, in brief</strong></h3>
            <p>I'm a fairly regular guy - married, with 2 young children, still closer to 30 than to 40 but only just. For reasons which would take me too long to go into here, but which basically stem from dissatisfaction with my current career path and the desire to do something more fun and rewarding, I decided in December 2016 to start seriously studying to learn how to code, and in particular how to be a Web Developer. This despite never having written a single line of code in my adult life! (I had messed with BASIC at about the age of 12 before losing interest, and while studying mathematics at university I had briefly had to use things like Matlab and R. But I did not consider either of the latter to be "programming".)</p>
            <p>I wasn't concerned by that though. I near enough <em>knew</em> I would be good at it, due to my background in abstract pure mathematics, and the fact that I was aware of the basic principles of coding (functions, loops etc.). What held me back for so long was the sheer amount of material to learn, the lack of having a clue where to start, and above all my belief in the clich&#233 that all the coding jobs went to 21-year-old wizkids who'd been programming in their bedrooms since the age of 10 or 11. When I spoke to some people in December 2016 and discovered that there were plenty of opportunities for a 30-something to learn from scratch <em>and then get a job</em>, I eagerly signed up for the course which seemed most promising to me - the mentored online Full Stack course with the <a href="https://www.codeinstitute.net/">Code Institute</a>.</p>
            <p>I am now near to the end of my studies - and let me tell you, it has been <strong>much</strong> more to me than a mere practical course of study. I have lived and breathed every minute of it - not just creating my required projects for assessment (although I had a great time doing those too), but also some projects I did on my own, just for the fun of learning and playing with code. I am always wanting to do more, ever conscious of how many languages, frameworks and libraries I still want to learn - as well as to deepen my knowledge of those which I already know. Despite the pressures of work and family, I have been reading about code, thinking about code, and writing code at every available moment in the past 8 months - and I do not expect that to ever stop.</p>
            <p>And that is why I have created this site. Both as another project to practice with, and more importantly as a way to sell my talents to the world - or at least to employers in my local area, the North East of England. I am absolutely desparate to start working professionally in this field, so that I can continue to learn, while also being able to spend time with my family and still get to bed before 2am most nights.</p>
            <h3><strong>Enough about why <em>you</em> want a job! Why should anyone employ you as a developer?</strong></h3>
            <p>I genuinely believe that I have many strengths to bring to any company who is willing to invest in a Junior Web Developer. Firstly, my incredible passion for the field should be clear from everything I have said above. Secondly, I am a very quick learner - just 8 months ago I had never heard of CSS or Javascript, and had only the very faintest conception of HTML. Now, I am able to code complex projects, as showcased here, on my own, and have gained deep understanding of a number of important libraries and frameworks along the way. While I do not at the time of writing know anything of PHP, or Ruby on Rails, or ReactJS, to name just a few - the only thing preventing me from learning any or all of these is time, and how I choose to prioritise. In time, I <em>will</em> teach myself all the important web languages and frameworks, and learn to use them well. But if I am employed as a developer, and need to learn one or more of these as part of the job - then with the proper support I will learn them much quicker, and put them to use for the good of the company, rather than just doing side projects that I personally find fun.</p>
            <p>To sum up: <strong>I will bring enormous passion, enthusiasm, and speed of learning to any role I may work in.</strong></p>
            <p>I am genuinely excited for my future as a developer - if you know of a company who would share my excitement and give me the one chance I need, please direct their attention to this site. And if you are hiring for such a company - thank you for reading. Please <a href="{% static 'CV.pdf' %}">download my CV</a> and get in touch with me.</p>
            <p id="closing"><strong> I greatly look forward to speaking to you.</strong></p>
            <p>Robin Zigmond,</p>
