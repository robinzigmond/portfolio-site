            <h3><strong>Reasons to hire me</strong></h3>
            <p>To keep it very brief: I do not believe you will find another developer who has more passion for the role - both for actively writing code and for learning new technologies. And I can learn - by both study and by doing - as fast as anyone else. Just a year ago I had never written any code at all, and knew nothing of any language. Since then I have created all the projects you can see in my <a href="/projects/">Portfolio</a>. While, depending on the role, I may not have as much technical knowledge as some other candidates (see <a href="/tech/">here</a> for what I already have a strong knowledge of), be in no doubt that I will bend over backwards to learn anything required as soon as I am offered the job - or even invited for interview.</p>
            <p>If you are looking for a junior developer anywhere in the North East of England, I would love to hear from you! Please get in touch via the contact details which you can find in my <a href="{% static 'CV.pdf' %}">CV</a></p>
            <h3><strong>A little about me</strong></h3>
            <p>This isn't a blog or anything, but just to make me seem a little more human :)</p>
            <p>I'm in my mid-30s, married with 2 young children. My main background is in mathematics - I harboured ambitions of becoming a professional mathematician before realising, while studying for my PhD, that much as I enjoyed the abstractions of pure mathematics, research-level pure mathematics was not something I was going to make a career of. Nonetheless I did complete my PhD, as evidenced <a href="http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/274/">here</a>.</p>
            <p>After that I just tried to get any kind of regular job - and eventually I did. But it is not one which offers any real hope of career progression, and I do not find it enjoyable any more. So in December 2016 I made the decision to seriously learn to code, with a view to completely changing career. Switching to a career as a web/software developer is my #1 ambition - because having fallen in love with coding while studying, I know that doing so professionally will keep me happy for my whole working life. Indeed I will keep on teaching myself new technologies, and practising via creating new projects for fun, even if I fail to make the career change - because coding for the web has become my main hobby.</p>
            <p>As is probably apparent from a glance at some of my projects, one of my biggest other interests is board games - I am a regular on <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/">BoardGameGeek</a>, my main interests being "Eurogames" and some card games. (<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/120677/terra-mystica">Terra Mystica</a> is my favourite game by far - although I am very excited by its successor <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/220308/gaia-project">Gaia Project</a>.)</p>
            <p>I also love listening to music - although by music I exclusively mean what is known as "classical" music. (I detest this term, but sadly there is no better one.) I have a very wide-ranging and even eclectic taste, although more concentrated on 20th-century composers (I try in vain to keep up with contemporary music as well). My favourite composers are probably Shostakovich, Mahler and Wagner - and among lesser-known composers I particularly love the mustic of the late-20th-century Soviet composer Alfred Schnittke.</p>
            <p id="closing">Most importantly though - as above, I cannot wait to start my professional career as a developer. Please take a look around my site, look at my <a href="{% static 'CV.pdf' %}">CV</a>, and get in touch if you have a role for me!</p>
            <p>Robin Zigmond,</p>
